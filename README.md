# MetaAnalysisReviewExtension

This repository contains a review and extension of a meta-analysis investigating the effects of physical exercise on telomere length. The study involved replicating findings, addressing methodological issues, and exploring extensions through subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

## Objectives
- Replicate the results of the original meta-analysis using R.
- Address methodological issues in the study, such as outcome measure consistency.
- Conduct subgroup analyses and meta-regression to explore potential moderators.
- Extend the analysis using change scores and refined statistical methods.

## Repository Structure
- `Meta analysis - review and extension - report.pdf`: The full report detailing the analysis, findings, and extensions.
- `Meta analysis - review and extension - code.R`: R script used for data processing, replication of results, and extended analyses.

## Methodology
- **Data Analysis**: R packages `meta` and `metafor` were employed for meta-analysis, subgroup analyses, and visualisation.
- **Extensions**: Change scores were calculated for enhanced accuracy, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to compare statistical estimators.
- **Visualisations**: Forest plots, funnel plots, and Baujat plots were created to assess heterogeneity and study influence.

## Results
- Replicated the original findings on telomere length changes due to exercise.
- Identified methodological inconsistencies in the original analysis.
- Highlighted potential benefits of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with caution due to limited data.
